#Clustering-of-Shopping-Mall-Customers-by-K-Means-Hierarchical-clustering
In this Machine Learning Project, I used unsupervised learning method which is clustering to analyze the shopping mall customers data sets. We're going to make the clusters of a datasets from the shopping mall customers based on their different characteristics like age, gender, income, spending etc. by **K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering**.<br>
<br>**At the end of this study, I hope we could achieve the following understandings regarding our problem:**<br>
- [x] What's a good way to segment our dataset on a small set of clusters?<br>
- [x] How can we achieve quick results using<br>
- [x] the Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pyplot and SKLearn modules?<br>
- [x] How the select the best hyperparameters for K-Means Clustering?<br>
- [x] How to get the Hierarchical Agglomerative Bottom-up approach of clustering?<br>
- [x] How to display and visualize data in the most honest and friendly way to our stakeholders?<br>
